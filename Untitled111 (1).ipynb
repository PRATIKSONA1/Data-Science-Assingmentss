    "# 8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Ans=\n",
    "Using logging messages is better than using print() to display the same message for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: With logging messages, you can control where the messages go (console, file, syslog, etc.), the level of importance of the message (debug, info, warning, error, critical), and the format of the message. This makes it easier to debug and diagnose problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity: By using different levels of logging messages, you can get a more granular view of what's happening in your program. For example, you might use debug-level messages to track down a specific issue, and then switch to info-level messages once you've found the root cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: Logging messages are generally more efficient than print statements, especially in production code. When you log a message, the message is only written once, regardless of how many times the code is run. With print statements, the message is written every time the code is run, which can slow down your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurability: With logging messages, you can configure the behavior of your program at runtime by changing the logging level, output format, and destination without modifying the code. This can be very useful when you need to debug a production system without stopping or restarting the program."

    "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are commonly used while debugging a program:\n",

    "Step Over: It executes the current line and moves to the next line in the code. If the current line contains a function call, the function is executed, and the results are returned before moving to the next line of the calling code.\n",
